```

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure all required directories and files are present
2. Run validation script: `python scripts/validate_structure.py`
3. Review entity requirements in `Entity_Specific/`
4. Generate review report: `python scripts/generate_review_report.py`

## File Templates
- SWIFT templates are located in `templates/SWIFT_template.md`
- Agreement templates are in `templates/agreement_template.md`

## Validation
Run the validation script before making any changes:
```bash
python scripts/validate_structure.py
```

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed Node.js (v16 or higher)
- You have installed pnpm (v7 or higher) or yarn (v1.22 or higher)
- You have a compatible operating system (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- You have a web browser installed

## Package Management
This project uses pnpm as the primary package manager. Key commands:
```bash
# Update dependencies
pnpm update           # Update all dependencies
pnpm update <package> # Update specific package

# If you encounter deprecated packages, run
pnpm audit           # Check for security issues
pnpm audit fix       # Attempt to fix security issues
```

### Known Deprecated Dependencies
The following dependencies are currently deprecated but still functional:
- abab@2.0.6
- domexception@2.0.1
- glob@7.2.3
- inflight@1.0.6
- rimraf@3.0.2
- w3c-hr-time@1.0.2

To handle these dependencies:
1. Monitor for major updates that resolve deprecation
2. Run `pnpm audit` regularly to check for security implications
3. Consider alternative packages if security issues arise

### Troubleshooting Package Issues
If you encounter dependency-related issues:

1. Clear package manager cache:
```bash
pnpm store prune
```

2. Remove node_modules and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
pnpm install
```

3. If specific packages fail, try installing them individually:
```bash
pnpm add <package>@latest
```
